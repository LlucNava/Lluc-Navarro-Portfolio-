      <h6 >This work is part of a small project where I explore how animals live alongside the changes humans have made to the planet. Through photography, I try to show the impact of our actions and how nature continues to adapt, survive, or sometimes struggle in the environments we’ve altered. It’s not just about images, but about telling meaningful stories.</h6>
      <h6>I’ve loved photography since I was a child. It has the power to capture unique moments, to express feelings, and to show the world through my eyes. For me, it’s both an art form and a way to communicate, simple, honest, and powerful.</h6>
